    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a passionate web developer and machine learning practitioner with a background as a graduate mechanical engineer. 
  My journey blends creativity and technical expertise, allowing me to build engaging, efficient, and intelligent web applications.</p>

<p>Alongside my engineering experience, I'm a certified computer-aided designer with proficiency in AutoCAD, which enhances my ability 
  to approach problems from both digital and mechanical perspectives. As an entrepreneur, I enjoy turning innovative ideas into real-world solutions and collaborating with others to make a meaningful impact.</p>

<p>Cars are another big passion of mine—I’m an automotive enthusiast who loves sharing insights and experiences on social media. 
  Whether it’s coding, designing, or exploring the latest in automotive tech, I’m always eager to learn, connect, and contribute 
  to exciting projects. Thanks for stopping by!</p> 

<p>Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or just chat about tech, design, or cars!</p>
